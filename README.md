# Election-Audit Summary: 

This script can be used in the future to perform any elections by refactoring the code with below modifications:

- We can write a common utility which reads .csv file taking the file path as input parameter.
-  We can do further analysis using data attributes such as age, gender, population to have further clarification on voting results. 
-  We just need to ensure the code is giving desired results by doing proper testing analysis.
